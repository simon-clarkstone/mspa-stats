Well, ok, it's not whiskey, but you decide to open your CRUET OF BRANDY and throw back a stiff belt. 

The alcohol has no effect on your VIM characteristic. But it quickly maxes out your crude little IMAGINATION gauge.

The room starts spinning. You'll need to duck into a safe place to expend the IMAGINATION fast.
