You shout, but he cannot hear you. The walls may be too thick, or he is just engrossed in his conversation. It sounds like he is arguing over a misunderstanding about the nature of the services provided by Busts-R-Us, and an alarmingly large bill for those services. 

In the darkness, you stub your toe on the false safe cover. You utter more profanity.
