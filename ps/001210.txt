Future Pickle Inspector is wondering the same thing.

It seems at some point in the future, FPI (the red one) used COMBAT OPERANDI -&gt; TEMPORAL REPLICSIMILE, again dividing him in two.

One of them went into the past to become Past-Future Pickle Inspector, PFPI (the blue one). That past moment is apparently now.

The other one went even further into the future to become Future-Future Pickle Inspector (a color yet to present itself).

FPI thanks PFPI for clarifying and asks him politely to go sit over there for the remainder of the battle to avoid confusion.
