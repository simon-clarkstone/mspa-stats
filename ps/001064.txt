Zombie and Fiesta Ace fall back to the deck. 

(Admiral Sleuth decides to call this the &quot;Ace Deck&quot; because he thinks it sounds clever. He also thinks he should be referred to as &quot;Admiral Sleuth&quot;, if only for a little while.)

Captain Snoop falls back down and crushes one of the PROPULSION FANS.

MK is now technically ascending from the carried-over momentum of his previous descent. Demonhood is imminent.
