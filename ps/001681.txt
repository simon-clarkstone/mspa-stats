The PART-PICKLES politely play the roles of each elementary particle in the standard model, namely quarks, electrons and neutrinos.

Their forces are propagated by different sorts of lumbering BONEHEADS, including photons and gluons, which lazily shuffle along at the speed of light.

The many particle/energy interactions have even created some MORONS and MORON NEUTRINOS. Sadly, their lifespans are rather short and they undergo the process of MORON DECAY.
