Life is good! You made a killing on the bangtails at the track and rolled your earnings into a lucrative empire of casinos, loansharking, ginmilling and rumrunning, which is sort of silly because the game of Life does not take place in the Prohibition Era, but more of a generic modern suburban setting where alcohol is perfectly legal. Still, you stick with what you know.

And to make your perfect life complete, your beautiful wife has just given birth to SONHEARST!

You nudge him affectionately in the snout to establish paternity.
