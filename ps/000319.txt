Suddenly, you are entirely dissatisfied with the condition of these horns. It is an absolute disgrace. You won't stand for it.

You set about polishing the instruments, but it seems your IMAGINATION is too high to conduct normal day-to-day activities. You topple some of the horns. The clarinet breaks. 

If only there were a place that could serve as a proper outlet for such a high degree of IMAGINATION until the condition passed.
