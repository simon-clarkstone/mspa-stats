It appears to be another business card. At a glance, one might think it was a calling card for a lady of the night named &quot;Muriel&quot; with a typo in her name, given the poor spelling exhibited elsewhere. 

But on closer inspection, it is more likely a misspelling for &quot;mural&quot;, given the smudged-out pun about walls. The suggestion in the phone number is probably regarding the old coat of paint rather than anyone's clothes. 

It's an easy enough mistake to make, though. You feel sorry for anyone who at any point in the past may have called while under the wrong impression.
