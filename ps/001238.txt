Surveying what you have in your inventory to put to use, you remember one of the Aces has the SMALL WINDOW and you have the SKYLIGHT with the BATTERY PACK.

The windows become knotted in each other to the extent your strength will allow. 

You will need to find a way to apply a lot more pressure to achieve the (un)desirable reaction!
