You advance to the next level.

The beast chunks were sort of heavy, so you could only throw one in ahead of you. You think it was still pretty cold blooded and intimidating though. 

Standing in your path is Argus of the Undead, MORTHOL DRYAX and his BONEGUARD MOUNT. He is flanked by two HIRED MUSCLES.

Against the wall is a beautiful and piously decorated STAINED GLASS WINDOW.
