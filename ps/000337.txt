You drink the COFFEE which is lukewarm. It is foul, bitter, and ridiculously strong. You can only drink a little of it. 

Your IMAGINATION is reduced, while your VIM enjoys a healthy boost. You feel terrific now! Fit as a fiddle, and bristling with coordination.

Two pieces of CANDY CORN fall on to the floor.
