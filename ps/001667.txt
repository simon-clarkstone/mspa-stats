It's DMK's third and final face. He is more fearsome than ever, with THREE HEALTH METERS, and a deadly BLACK HOLE VERSION OF HIS NON-IMAGINARY SELF pulsing on top of his HAT.

In addition to which, he is completely invulnerable to all physical attacks, and has no weakness to increases in BLOOD SUGAR or EMOTIONS. He is only susceptible to damage caused by righteous fires of charisma, but it is doubtful there is any hero in the cosmos bold enough to wield them. 

OH. He also regenerates any quantity of damage he suffers instantaneously.

Good luck!
