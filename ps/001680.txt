Each PI divides himself into two smaller parts, deploying one to the past, the other to the future. 

Their parts continue this process, ad infinitum.

Soon the PART-PICKLES are so small they exist on the atomic scale, and so plentiful, they occupy every location in every moment of the universe's history.
