The Gentlemen aggress this uncouth ruffian with the sort of tactics that strike their fancy at the moment: by waging stiff contest through a series of old-timey childhood games!

The Dapper Swain makes a smashing play with his RUBBER BALL and announces the triumph by bellowing &quot;horse before carriage!&quot; as is the only proper way. However before he can scoop the JACKS up, they vanish into the field.

The Churlish Toff is having a devil of a time with the match of STICKBALL. His ball bounces into the field as well, never to be recovered.
