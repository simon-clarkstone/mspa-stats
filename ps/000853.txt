You head for the skull slots, but along the way, to save time, you just drop it through the SKYLIGHT for Problem Sleuth to pick up.

Problem Sleuth eyes his own SKULL with unease. 

You wonder why the skulls seem so much smaller than your own head, but you're not about to get hung up on that detail.
