This is getting kind of confusing.

Godhead Pickle Inspector thinks you should just relax and have fun, and not worry too much about it.

But if you need a refresher on what's actually going on with all these character duplicates and time-bending shenanigans, he offers the scoop.

There is still only one Problem Sleuth, who is off in some enchanted land sifting through a political crisis. 

There is one real Pickle Inspector, and there were 8 imaginary Pickle Inspectors. All but two of them were killed, and one became GPI. The other one just split into two, and one of those just went back in time and died. The other one went into the future, possibly to reappear some time later. This means there is now one real Pickle Inspector in the present, and one imaginary one in the future.

There are 3 Ace Dicks, for the following reasons.

PS, AD and PI each have a lady counterpart, in accordance with deep seated mythology that dictates that any man secretly wishes to have sex with a female version of himself (re: Alvin and the Chipmunks, Mickey/Minnie, etc.) HD is PS's counterpart, NB is PI's, while AD is his own counterpart because he has a very poor imagination. So that's one duplicate AD, the one with the wig/helmet. 

Also, a while ago AD used a game code to restore an earlier state in the game. That earlier version of AD went through the storefront and out the music box and became small AD. Meanwhile, the present AD went about his business in the present. 

That makes 3 Ace Dicks, the normal one, the small one with the skull (though now normal-sized), and the girl one, who is not actually a girl.

See, how hard was that???
