Death was unsuccessful in his attempt to shoo everyone back in the door, so they have no choice but to brace for impact.

Ace Dick shields sweet Bathearst from the terrific blast. You won't lose him this time. Never again, you say. Never again.

The tender reunion causes DMK to grow a second EMOTIONS gauge. What are you doing to this poor man??
