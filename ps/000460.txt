Ace Dick enters the back room.

There are a couple of stills. One is for making illicit liquor during the prohibition era. Another is for making another sort of substance, possibly also illicit. All of the liquor appears to have been stolen!

There are some HANDGUN BULLET(S) on the floor. There is also a target painted on the ceiling for some reason.

Loud swing music and lively footsteps are heard from the room above.
