You exit the rear cabin of the HAM TRUCK, squashing your proportions even more. The look strikes you as unbecoming.

Furthermore, the plug's proportions have been squashed too. Even if you did manage to shrink it down somehow, there would be no way it could fit into a normal outlet!

Weird puzzle shit can be really frustrating sometimes.
