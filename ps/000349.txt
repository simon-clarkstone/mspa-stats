It is the office of yet another one of your competitors, Pickle Inspector. He looks dazed, as if perhaps he's been trapped in his office for some time. 

There are strange glass containers in the corner. You wonder if there might be a business card (worded professionally, of course) for a glass blower somewhere in his office. Perhaps taped to something, like a cinderblock, or the back of an elf painting. 

His office is dark for some reason.
