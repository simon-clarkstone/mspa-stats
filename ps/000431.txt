You find Problem Sleuth on the street. He is rounding up items scattered on the street and tying them to the magnetic tape.

It looks like he brought down a LARGE BAG OF CANDY CORN from his office. He may have considered tying it to the tape, but it is too heavy to be hauled up through the window. It probably will need to be hauled up by something stronger, like a rope. Perhaps one slung around a pulley...
