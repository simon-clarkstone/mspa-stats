This is what being a hard boiled problem sleuth is all about. It's about being a strong, silent type, oozing with confidence, charisma, and other fine qualities such as not being trapped in your own office. It's about having a working phone. A real desk. Not one, but two steak dinners. And some hysterical broad on the line, yackin' about some fella she's got troubles with. It's always the same thing with dames. You comfort yourself in your sublime fantasy by now and then saying things into the phone such as, &quot;Now calm down a second, toots...&quot; and &quot;Hey, take it easy, sweetheart. I can barely understand a word you're sayin'...&quot; 

RING-RING.

Your call is rudely interrupted by a ringing noise. It can't be the phone, because you're already on it!
