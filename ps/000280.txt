Gadzooks! It's another urban mural. This one is particularly unpleasant. You have a feeling it might have been placed there just to annoy you.

You hear a voice from the other side. It's hard to tell what it is saying, but you think you can make out the words &quot;toots&quot; and &quot;sweatheart&quot; now and then.

It's hard to tell how far away the mural is. The clown's eyes are so close together, you can only see through one at a time, limiting your depth perception. You wonder what kind of freak this painting was made for.

If only you had some sort of thin, extendable implement to poke through the hole to tell how far away it is.
