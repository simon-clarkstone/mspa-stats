The window appears to be stuck in itself, knotted into a strange multi-dimensional wreath. 

The ACCRETION RATE is at a dangerous level, but the degree of fractaline matter replication is in check due to the self-knotting structure. 

If any pressure was applied to the windows, it would likely force a critical reaction. This is to be avoided.
