You think it's pretty clear Death has abandoned your friendly game for good. You don't want to leave a mess, so you neatly put the game back in its box.

Meanwhile, you sense your temporal counterpart has finally split in two, sending one into the past (you), and the other into the future (FFPI).

You may finally join the battle while keeping the confusion to a minimum.
