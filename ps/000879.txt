You grab the OFFICE WINDOW and the SKYLIGHT, and head up to your office window. 

You leave behind Problem Sleuth's OFFICE WINDOW because it is just too damn heavy and cumbersome.

You go to the skull slot room. The doors unfortunately are locked. It will probably take about double your own considerable strength to bust through them.
