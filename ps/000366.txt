The scaffolding is jammed in place! It seems the brake for the wheels was triggered after it came to a stop. You can't push it away either. The top just bumps up against the ceiling. There's no climbing out of the window with your portly frame because of the scaffold bars.

Unless someone comes to help you, or you find a blowtorch to melt through the bars, you're probably not getting out of this office any time soon. Nice try though!
