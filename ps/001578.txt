Weakened by starvation and grief, you crawl to a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=1&amp;p=000108" target="_blank" class="postlink">TREE STUMP</a> and collapse. A peculiar aura of misery surrounds the stump, but you are too depressed to give it much thought.

You are at the end of your rope. Your days of success and happiness are a distant memory. You are a husk of a man.
